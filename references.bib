	abstract="Performance comparison among various architectures is generally attained by using standard benchmark tools. This paper presents JetBench, an Open Source OpenMP based multicore benchmark application that could be used to analyse real time performance of a specific target platform. The application is designed to be platform independent by avoiding target specific libraries and hardware counters and timers. JetBench uses jet engine parameters and thermodynamic equations presented in the NASA's EngineSim program, and emulates a real-time jet engine performance calculator. The user is allowed to determine a flight profile with timing constraints, and adjust the number of threads. This paper discusses the structure of the application, thread distribution and its scalability on a custom symmetric multicore platform based on a cycle accurate full system simulator.",
