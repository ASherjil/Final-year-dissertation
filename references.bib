	abstract="Performance comparison among various architectures is generally attained by using standard benchmark tools. This paper presents JetBench, an Open Source OpenMP based multicore benchmark application that could be used to analyse real time performance of a specific target platform. The application is designed to be platform independent by avoiding target specific libraries and hardware counters and timers. JetBench uses jet engine parameters and thermodynamic equations presented in the NASA's EngineSim program, and emulates a real-time jet engine performance calculator. The user is allowed to determine a flight profile with timing constraints, and adjust the number of threads. This paper discusses the structure of the application, thread distribution and its scalability on a custom symmetric multicore platform based on a cycle accurate full system simulator.",

While distributed memory applications are able to improve the performance of their I/O operations by using parallel I/O libraries, there is no support for parallel I/O operations for applications using shared-memory programming models such as OpenMP available as of today. This paper presents parallel I/O interfaces for OpenMP. We discuss the rationale of our design decisions, present the interface specification, an implementation within the OpenUH compiler and discuss a number of optimizations performed. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach on different file systems for multiple benchmarks and application scenarios. In most cases, we observe significant improvements in I/O performance as compared to the sequential version. Furthermore, we perform a comparison of the OpenMP I/O functions introduced in this paper to message passing interface I/O, and demonstrate the benefits of the new interfaces.},

	abstract = {Applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) based remote sensing is increasing rapidly due to their advanced accessibility, capability for fast and easy deployment, capability for miniaturization of sensors and efficient collection of remotely-sensed data from relatively low altitudes. Recently, UAV data sets have been found to be quite useful for forest feature identification due to their relatively high spatial resolution. Several machine learning algorithms have been broadly used for remotely-sensed image classification. In remote sensing image classification, deep learning based methods can be considered quite effective techniques as they have achieved promising results. In this study, we have used deep learning based supervised image classification algorithm and images collected using UAV for classification of forest areas. The deep learning algorithm stacked Auto-encoder has been found to have tremendous potential regarding image classification and the assessment of forest coverage area. Our experimental results show that deep learning method provides better accuracy compared to other machine learning algorithms. Cross-validation showed that the overall accuracy of the deep learning method is about 93%. This study highlights the essential role that UAV observations and deep learning could play in the planning and management of forest areas which are often under the threat of deforestation and forest encroachment.},
